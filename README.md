# Chess.java

Welcome to Chess.java, a classical chess game implementation written in Java. This project aims to provide a user-friendly and interactive chess experience through a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI offers an intuitive and visually appealing way to play chess on your computer.

## Project Timeline

- **Start Date:** 19/5/2024
- **End Date:** xx/5/24

## Features

The Chess.java program includes the following features:

- [Castling of King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling#:~:text=Castling%20is%20permitted%20only%20if,pieces%20are%20moved%20at%20once.): The ability to castle the King under the appropriate conditions.
- [En Passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant): The pawn can capture an opponent's pawn that has just advanced two squares from its original square and is now on an adjacent file.
- Move Validation: Ensures that all moves made by the players adhere to the rules of chess.
- Check Detection: Identifies when a player's King is in check and provides appropriate notifications.
- Checkmate Detection: Recognizes when a player has achieved checkmate, ending the game.
- Pawn Promotion: Allows pawns to be promoted to a different piece (Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight) upon reaching the opposite end of the board.
